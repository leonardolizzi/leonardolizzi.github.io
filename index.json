Therefore, they are handy devices able to perform received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements for a wide variety of applications such as cellular coverage maps, indoor localization, or proximity tracking. However, to the best of our knowledge, the accuracy of such measurements has never been rigorously assessed. The goals of this article are to assess the accuracy of the RSSI measurements made with a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) smartphone in a variety of conditions and how possible inaccuracies can be corrected. We primarily focus on the long-term evolution (LTE) RSSI, but we also extend our results to the Bluetooth RSSI. In this article, we build a controlled experimental setup based on commodity hardware and on open-source software. We evaluate the granularity and limitations of the Android application programming interface (API) that returns the RSSI. We explore how reliable the measurements in a controlled environment with a mono-polarized antenna are. We show that the orientation of the smartphone, the position or orientation of the source, and the transmission power have a significant impact on the accuracy of the measurements. We introduce several correction techniques based on radiation matrix manipulations and on machine learning in order to improve measurement accuracy to less than 5-dBm RMSE, when compared to a professional equipment. We also explore the reliability of measurements made in an outdoor realistic environment. We show that although transmission diversity available in LTE base stations significantly improves the measured RSSI regardless of the smartphone orientation, the Bluetooth RSSI remains largely sensitive to the smartphone orientation.","tags":["\"Antenna measurements\"","\"Accuracy\"","\"Long Term Evolution\"","\"Radio frequency\"","\"Hardware\"","\"Bluetooth\"","\"Wireless fidelity\"","\"calibration\"","\"long-term evolution (LTE)\"","\"received signal strength indicator (RSSI)\"","\"sensors\"","\"Smart phones\"","\"smartphone\"","\"software-defined radio (SDR)\""],"title":"Evaluating Smartphone Accuracy for RSSI Measurements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maria Elbacha","Fabien Ferrero","Leonardo Lizzi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631288317,"objectID":"c764a54b3229b3d61ddedd989f142eeb","permalink":"/publication/elbacha-wearable-2021/","publishdate":"2021-09-10T15:38:37.442055Z","relpermalink":"/publication/elbacha-wearable-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, a wearable waveguide surface for Body Area Network (BAN) communications is proposed.

A higher directivity in a small antenna is closely connected with a narrow impedance bandwidth. The relation between bandwidth and a desired directivity is still not fully understood, not even for small antennas. Initial investigations in this direction have related the radius of a circumscribing sphere to the directivity, and bounds on the Q-factor have also been derived for a partial directivity in a given direction. In this paper, we derive lower bounds on the Q-factor for a total desired directivity for an arbitrarily shaped antenna in a given direction as a convex problem using semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques. We also show that the relaxed solution is also a solution of the original problem of determining the lower Q-factor bound for a total desired directivity. SDR can also be used to relax a class of other interesting nonconvex constraints in antenna optimization, such as tuning, losses, and front-to-back ratio.

These techniques, previously exclusive to specific domains of applications, will spur interest to reach beyond localization, and now allow to consider estimating the device's orientation in space, that once required other sources of information. Wi-Fi's popularity and the availability of metrics related to channel propagation (CSI), makes it a candidate readily available for experimentation. Accordingly, we propose the ORION system to estimate the orientation (heading and yaw) of a MIMO Wi-Fi equipped object, relying on a joint estimation of the angle of arrival and the angle of departure. Although the CSI's phase data is plagued by several phase inconsistencies, we demonstrate that an appropriate phase compensation strategy significantly improves estimation accuracy. Our technique allows estimating orientations within millimeter-level precision.","tags":["\"Antenna measurements\"","\"Receiving antennas\"","\"MIMO\"","\"MIMO communication\"","\"Antenna arrays\"","\"direction-of-arrival estimation\"","\"Estimation\"","\"antenna arrays\"","\"wireless LAN\"","\"Radio frequency\"","\"Wi-Fi\"","\"array signal processing\"","\"angle of arrival\"","\"angle of departure\"","\"antenna array signal processing techniques\"","\"channel propagation\"","\"Channel State Information (CSI)\"","\"commodity hardware\"","\"commodity Wi-Fi\"","\"CSI phase data\"","\"fine-grained localization\"","\"Localization\"","\"MIMO Wi-Fi\"","\"orientation estimation\"","\"Orientation estimation\"","\"ORION system\"","\"phase compensation strategy\"","\"Wireless fidelity\""],"title":"ORION: Orientation estimation using commodity Wi-Fi","type":"publication"},{"authors":["K.

A low complexity and energy efficient scanning process is embedded in RDA-RICER to identify the direction providing the highest received signal strength Indicator between two nodes.

Battery lifetime continues to be the main bottleneck in these small form factor devices, thus low power design and advanced power management techniques are required to sustain the increasing demands on power. As radio transceivers are typically the most power hungry subsystem in a wearable sensors device, optimizations to reduce the communication power consumption, such as using adaptive power management coupled with ultra-low power receivers have been widely investigated. In this work, we focus on the design of a novel wearable wake-up radio consuming only few nW during listening mode, significantly reducing the overall power consumption of communication, which enables aggressive power management techniques. We propose the co-design of an ad-hoc wearable antenna which directly matches the impedance of the analog frontend in order to improve the performance in terms of sensitivity and directivity in BAN context. Our novel wake up radio consumes only 400nW while providing short-range communication, and features on board addressing capability to further reduce the power due to false wake ups. Using in-field measurements, we evaluate the benefits of the ad-hoc antenna compared to state-of-the-art off-the-shelf solutions in terms of range, sensitivity and addressing capability. We quantify energy savings and estimate the lifetime prolongation of the sensor node by integrating our wake-up radio in a wearable system.","tags":["\"Impedance\"","\"wireless sensor networks\"","\"Receiving antennas\"","\"wearable antennas\"","\"Ad hoc networks\"","\"ad hoc networks\"","\"ad-hoc wearable antenna codesign\"","\"adaptive power management technique\"","\"BAN\"","\"body area network\"","\"Body Area Network\"","\"body area networks\"","\"communication power consumption\"","\"health tracking\"","\"lifetime prolongation estimation\"","\"mobile communication\"","\"optimisation\"","\"optimization\"","\"power 400 nW\"","\"Power demand\"","\"power hungry subsystem\"","\"Power Management\"","\"radio transceiver\"","\"radio transceivers\"","\"Sensitivity\"","\"telecommunication network reliability\"","\"telecommunication power management\"","\"Ultra Low Power Design\"","\"ultralow power receiver\"","\"Wake up Radio\"","\"wake-up receiver\"","\"Wearable Antenna\"","\"wearable sensor device\"","\"wearable wake-up radio consumption\""],"title":"A wake-up receiver with ad-hoc antenna co-design for wearable applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

With dimensions of 40 ×10 ×6 mm3 for the antenna and 130 ×70 ×0.8 mm3 for the whole printed circuit board (PCB), this structure is compatible with any mobile terminal.","tags":["\"Antennas\"","\"Antenna measurements\"","\"5G mobile communication\"","\"Prototypes\"","\"Capacitors\"","\"microwave antennas\"","\"Bandwidth\"","\"3G mobile communication\"","\"mobile antennas\"","\"Frequency measurement\"","\"Long Term Evolution\"","\"5G communications\"","\"antenna structure\"","\"Capacitance\"","\"capacitors\"","\"DCS/PCS\"","\"digitally tunable capacitor\"","\"frequency 3.5 GHz\"","\"GSM 850/900 standards\"","\"handset antenna\"","\"LTE 1800/2600\"","\"LTE 600/700\"","\"mobile terminal\"","\"mobile terminals\"","\"multiband antenna\"","\"PCB\"","\"printed circuit board\"","\"printed circuits\"","\"reconfigurable antenna\"","\"spectrum reallocations\"","\"UMTS\""],"title":"Reconfigurable Antenna for Future Spectrum Reallocations in 5G Communications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo Lizzi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1443657600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606057440,"objectID":"d0bbca3998e93daca894f8859e2ee674","permalink":"/publication/lizzi-pattern-2015/","publishdate":"2020-11-22T15:04:00.431913Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lizzi-pattern-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Pattern reconfigurable antennas in wireless sensor networks: challenges and opportunities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.

The device is applied to a standard plexiglas rack cage for housing mice. The mouse phantom model localization in the cage is deduced from the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) level measurements of each antenna. Four zones are defined, one for each antenna and the position is determined by the highest received RSSI level. Two cases have been considered depending if there is one or four phantom models present simultaneously in the cage. Results show a good correlation between the real positions and the RSSI levels obtained by the four antennas.","tags":["\"Antenna measurements\"","\"battery-less RFID tag\"","\"biological telemetry relevance\"","\"biomedical telemetry\"","\"cross printed dipole array\"","\"dipole antenna arrays\"","\"Dipole antennas\"","\"frequency 863 MHz to 870 MHz\"","\"level measurement\"","\"Mice\"","\"microstrip antenna arrays\"","\"mobile computing\"","\"mouse localization system\"","\"mouse phantom model\"","\"Phantoms\"","\"radiofrequency identification\"","\"received signal strength indication level measurements\"","\"Receiving antennas\"","\"RSSI level measurements\"","\"short range devices frequency band\"","\"SRD frequency band\"","\"UHF antennas\""],"title":"RSSI measurements to achieve mouse localization in a cage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

The inversion problem is solved by means of a nested procedure that considers three different logical levels: (a) an outer multi-focusing loop aimed at implementing a synthetic zoom for focusing the scatterer support within the investigation domain; (b) a local linearization of the original full-nonlinear inverse scattering function; and (c) a truncated Landweber inner loop devoted to regularize the arising ill-posed linear problem. Thanks to the features of the integrated approach, a reliable inversion technique able to suitably face the non-linearity and the ill-posedness/ill-conditioning issues of the imaging problem is designed. A numerical validation dealing with different objects, measurement setups, and noise conditions is carried out to assess the features and the potentialities as well as the limitations of the proposed strategy.

For example, the polyfractal [1] and RPS [2] topologies are capable of exhibiting remarkably wide frequency bandwidths on the order of 20:1, 40:1 or even more, depending on the array size. Often, the antenna elements that are capable of these extended bandwidths begin to develop several lobes in the radiation pattern and generate increased cross-polarized radiation at their upper range of operating frequencies. A new type of ultra-wideband antenna has been developed based on a spline-shaping technique and a particle swarm algorithm (PSO) [3]. With proper attention to the radiation pattern, cross-polarization, and return loss in the PSO cost function, this method is capable of producing UWB antenna elements that minimize all the aforementioned undesirable characteristics, making them very suitable for use in UWB array systems with bandwidths up to 4:1 and perhaps even wider.","tags":["\"Antenna radiation patterns\"","\"Arrays\"","\"particle swarm optimisation\"","\"Bandwidth\"","\"ultra wideband antennas\"","\"Ultra wideband antennas\"","\"Layout\"","\"antenna arrays\"","\"aperiodic array topologies\"","\"design methodology\"","\"optimized ultrawideband elements\"","\"particle swarm algorithm\"","\"ultra-wideband antenna\"","\"ultra-wideband array technologies\"","\"UWB antenna\"","\"UWB array systems\""],"title":"A novel design methodology for integration of optimized ultra-wideband elements with aperiodic array topologies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

In order to reach polarization flexibility, the integration of actively controlled elements in standard array configurations is often employed, but the overall system complexity and costs significantly increase. To overcome such limitations, the use of two shared aperture arrays with independent polarizations was proposed in by exploiting an interleaving scheme based on Difference-Sets (DSs). By combining the field generated by each sub-array, arbitrary polarizations, low sidelobes, large steering angles, and narrow beamwidths can be reached with a limited complexity of the underlying feeding network. Despite its theoretical and practical advantages, only few planar array geometries can be synthesized because of the limited number of available DS sequences.","tags":["\"Indexes\"","\"ADS interleaved arrays\"","\"almost difference sets\"","\"aperture arrays\"","\"Apertures\"","\"cancel clutters\"","\"chaffs\"","\"detection probability\"","\"jammers\"","\"jamming\"","\"Layout\"","\"planar antenna arrays\"","\"planar array geometry\"","\"Planar arrays\"","\"polarisation\"","\"Polarization\"","\"polarization-reconfigurable arrays\"","\"radar clutter\"","\"radar systems\"","\"reconfigurable polarization\""],"title":"ADS interleaved arrays with reconfigurable polarization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

A Rayleigh distribution is used to characterize the relevance of the observed object with respect to the distance from the camera and a Gaussian distribution is adopted to model the horizontal field-of-view. Knowing the environment characteristics and the location of obstacles and walls, it is possible to derive a reliable positioning of the sensors. Results are first presented for very simple scenarios; the algorithm is then run to solve the problem in a more realistic environment model.","tags":["\"particle swarm optimisation\"","\"particle swarm optimization\"","\"Indoor environments\"","\"Particle swarm optimization\"","\"PSO\"","\"Layout\"","\"Monitoring\"","\"ad-hoc tool\"","\"camera model\"","\"camera placement\"","\"Cameras\"","\"Gaussian distribution\"","\"position control\"","\"Rayleigh distribution\"","\"Security\"","\"Sensor phenomena and characterization\"","\"sensor placement\"","\"Sensor systems\"","\"sensors positioning\"","\"video cameras\"","\"video cameras positioning\"","\"video surveillance\"","\"Video surveillance\"","\"visual surveillance applications\""],"title":"Camera placement using particle swarm optimization in visual surveillance applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

Since the bit rate of UWB at short distances is already very high, non-negligible improvements can be obtained only at large distances. Consequently, MIMO techniques in UWB systems should be devoted to exploit the diversity gain to increase the communication range. Moreover, it should considered that the variations of the environment conditions could change the working region of the MIMO-UWB system with a decreasing of the achievable gain.

The quest for Earth impact craters entails the exploitation of Earth Observation products and of their processing for the identification of crater features, their detection and possible recognition. In the past decades, impacts by extraterrestrial bodies were regarded as an interesting but certainly not important phenomenon in the spectrum of geological processes affecting the dynamic evolution of the Earth. On the contrary, at the present, the attention devoted to this phenomenon is significantly increased, thanks to the important role played by planetary exploration. According to planetary scientists [1], impact cratering was a dominant geological process during the growth of the planetary bodies of the Solar System. The emerging of this kind of view of planets as geological objects, places the search for unknown impact craters as a basic element for the study of the evolution of the planets, and in particular of the Earth. In this context, this paper addresses the issue of recognition and detection of impact craters on the Earth by using Earth Observation products (i.e. remote sensing images). In particular, approaches based on the Hough Transform and on the Radial Consistency measure are considered and compared. In addition, novel techniques (based on the use of the K-means algorithm and of stochastic processes) for the reduction of the computational load associated with the considered approaches are described. Preliminary experimental results are reported that point out advantages and disadvantages of the considered methods.","tags":[],"title":"Recognition and Detection of Impact Craters from EO Products","type":"publication"}]
