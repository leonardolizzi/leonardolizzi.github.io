 abstract = {This paper introduces the design and simulation of multiband dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) for the fifth generation (5G) of cellular networks. The radiating element is a unique rectangular shaped DRA element with a distribution feeding technique based on micro-strip feed line coupled via an elliptical slot. The feed position and configuration has been deliberately designed for optimized matching. The structure is approximately 40mm√ó48mm in size, conceived on Arlan dielectric substrate. The antenna has been optimized for the 10.5-17 GHz frequency bands. Simulated return loss, radiation pattern and gain over the frequencies of interest have been presented. The proposed antenna structure is a good candidate for future 5G cellular applications.},
