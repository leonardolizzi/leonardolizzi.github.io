 abstract = {In this work, we compare two different antenna topologies integrated in a miniature IoT device working at 900 MHz: Inverted F Antenna (IFA) and Dielectric Resonator Antenna (DRA). This type of handheld device can be strongly impacted by human body effect, consequently we study the radiation performance of the two structures close to a human hand. Electromagnetic simulations show for the IFA a 15 dB decrease of the total efficiency with hand influence, while the DRA total efficiency is only decreased by 2 dB in the same situation.},
