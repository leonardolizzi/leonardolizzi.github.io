 abstract = {In this letter, the design of a quad-band antenna is presented. The antenna has a planar geometry printed on a dielectric substrate orthogonal to a reference ground plane and its geometrical parameters are optimized starting from a Hilbert-like prefractal reference shape. The reliability of the synthesized antenna is assessed by means of a set of experimental tests to verify its compliance with the project constraints.},
