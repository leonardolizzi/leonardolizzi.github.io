 abstract = {A compact end-launcher with 30 Ã— 30 mm terminal form factor enabling body area network (BAN) communication through a waveguide surface is proposed. It targets Bluetooth communication at 2.4 GHz for on-body communication. The wireless power transmission is studied in both planar and curved scenarios.},
