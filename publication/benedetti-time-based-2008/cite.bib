 abstract = {In this paper, an innovative approach for the synthesis of antennas fitting the requirements of an UWB communication system has been presented. Such an approach allows one to design UWB antennas with distortionless propagation properties as well as good impedance matching over the whole band of interest. As expected, the use of a time-domain technique permits the accurate modeling of the antennas, the communication channel, and of the mutual interactions.},
