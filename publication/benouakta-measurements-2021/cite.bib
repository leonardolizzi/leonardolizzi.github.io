 abstract = {This paper presents the effect of the polarization of antennas used in Ultra-Wideband systems for positioning applications. Measurements have been conducted using the DecaWave DWM1000 module and its antennas on both the transmitter (tag) and receiver (anchor) sides. The received power with the anchor-tag distance were measured with two conÔ¨Ågurations, co-polarization and cross-polarization of the two antennas.},
