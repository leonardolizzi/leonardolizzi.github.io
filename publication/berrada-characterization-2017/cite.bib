 abstract = {In this paper, a fast characterization technique for on-body small devices is presented. This method is used to extract the radiation performance of two different structures placed on a belt over a human abdomen at 868 MHz. Results show that the Planar Inverted F structure has a measured Mean Gain 7.65 dB higher than the planar IFA structure for the on-body scenario.},
