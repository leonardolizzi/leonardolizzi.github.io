 abstract = {In this paper, the effect of the human body proximity on LPWAN antennas is investigated. Both numerical and experimental tests are performed on two different IoT devices. The obtained results show that the performance degradation caused by the body absorption can be disastrous if the antenna is not properly designed.},
