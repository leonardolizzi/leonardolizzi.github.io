 abstract = {In this work, we show how to set up a cellular LTE network for wireless experimentation and measurement, relying on commodity hardware and open-source software. We first deploy a complete LTE network on a single laptop and an SDR hardware. Then, we use it to evaluate the reception performance of a commercial smartphone. In the end, we propose a calibration technique which allows using a smartphone as a wireless power measurement tool by reducing the root-mean-square error of the RSSI, with respect to a reference power measured with a specialized spectrum analyzer, from 6.4 dBm to 2.4 dBm.},
