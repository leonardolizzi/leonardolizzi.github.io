 abstract = {In this paper an Inexact-Newton method, based on the truncated Landweber algorithm, is used within a multi-resolution scheme, called the iterative multi-scale approach, in order to efficiently solve inverse electromagnetic scattering problems. In particular, the case of separated scatterers is addressed and the performances of the described approach are numerically evaluated, also by means of noisy data.},
