 abstract = {Impact craters represent a novel and fundamental field of research in 
Solar System studies. The quest for Earth impact craters entails the
exploitation of Earth Observation products and of their processing for
the identification of crater features, their detection and possible
recognition. In the past decades, impacts by extraterrestrial bodies
were regarded as an interesting but certainly not important phenomenon
in the spectrum of geological processes affecting the dynamic evolution
of the Earth. On the contrary, at the present, the attention devoted to
this phenomenon is significantly increased, thanks to the important role
played by planetary exploration. According to planetary scientists [1],
impact cratering was a dominant geological process during the growth of
the planetary bodies of the Solar System. The emerging of this kind of
view of planets as geological objects, places the search for unknown
impact craters as a basic element for the study of the evolution of the
planets, and in particular of the Earth. In this context, this paper
addresses the issue of recognition and detection of impact craters on
the Earth by using Earth Observation products (i.e. remote sensing
images). In particular, approaches based on the Hough Transform and on
the Radial Consistency measure are considered and compared. In addition,
novel techniques (based on the use of the K-means algorithm and of
stochastic processes) for the reduction of the computational load
associated with the considered approaches are described. Preliminary
experimental results are reported that point out advantages and
disadvantages of the considered methods.},
