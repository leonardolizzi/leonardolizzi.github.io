 abstract = {In this paper, a 5G MIMO mobile phone prototype including four antennas working in the 10-13.2 GHz band is designed. The objective of the study is to evaluate the negative impact due to the user's hand in frequencies higher than 10 GHz. A 3D spherical near-field scanner with fixed Antenna Under Test (AUT) is leveraged in order to measure a 3D radiation pattern with a real human hand impact. S-parameters, radiation pattern and efficiency are presented. First results show that radiation pattern and efficiency are strongly impacted by the hand. This effect has to be carefully considered for millimeter Wave handheld terminal design.},
