 abstract = {This paper presents a low-cost measurement method for MIMO antenna performance assessment based on the open-source OpenAirInterface initiative. MISO 8×1 measurements are presented to experimentally prove the reproductibility of the test method, using a prototype with 8 antennas at 2.6 GHz integrated into a 140×140×40 mm femto cell. The results shows that measurements are repeatable with a good accuracy. Beamforming performance are presented to finalize the validation of the setup.},
