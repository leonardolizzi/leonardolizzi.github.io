 abstract = {A novel antenna geometry that alters between four possible states in order to collect RF energy around it is introduced in this paper. Planar Yagi-Uda elements are combined to beam steer at different angles with a large coverage. The antenna operates at 2.44 GHz and has a maximum dimension of 0.55Î».},
