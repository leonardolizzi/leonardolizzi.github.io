 abstract = {This paper presents a miniature antenna in Ultra High Frequency (UHF) band fabricated using liquid metal and additive technologies. Such an approach allows the accurate realization of compact and complex antenna structures. The design as well as the realization of the antenna are discussed. In order to assess the effectiveness of the proposed solution, simulated and measured results are reported. The antenna small dimensions and good efficiency make it a good candidate for internet-of-things (IoT) applications.},
