 abstract = {In this work, the use of a planar antenna system for the estimation of the directions of arrivals (DOAs) of multiple signals impinging on the receiver has been considered. Towards this end, an efficient multiresolution method based on a SVM-classifier is proposed for determining a probabilitic map of the DOAs of the unknown interfering signals. Numerical results dealing with multiple interferers scenarios in noisy environments are provided in order to assess the feasibility as well as the capability of the proposed approach.},
