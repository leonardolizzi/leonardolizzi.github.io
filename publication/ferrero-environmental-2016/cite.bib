 abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of the environmental sensitivity of miniature antennas to be integrated in Internet-of-Things devices. A representative example regarding the design of a dual-band miniature antenna for geolocation applications is reported. Different solutions to solve this issue are discussed in the last part of the paper.},
