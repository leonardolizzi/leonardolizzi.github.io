 abstract = {Internet of thing will soon connect billion of objects together. Interference with existing standard in the ISM bands and outside is a hot issue to solve. Ultra-narrow band modulation has recently been proposed to decrease interference for low-data rate system. To simplify frontend design, ultra-narrow band (UNB) antenna could be used to prefiltered the RF signal. A first proof-of-concept is proposed with a measured quality factor of 354 at 1.39 GHz and a total efficiency of -3.8dB.},
