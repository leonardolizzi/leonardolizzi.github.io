 abstract = {A super-directive parasitic element system, with a diameter of the minimum sphere circumscribing the antenna equal to 0.2Î»0, is simulated and measured. A maximum directivity of 7.2 dBi is measured with a radiation efficiency of -6.5 dB at 876MHz. An intermediate directivity of 5.5 dBi is observed at 884MHz with 12 dB front-to-back ratio and -2.3 dB radiation efficiency. This result is promising for spatial filtering applications.},
