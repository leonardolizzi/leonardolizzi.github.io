 abstract = {A compact pattern reconfigurable antenna with four radiation patterns is proposed for sub-GHz IoT applications. The antenna has two functional modes; Mode I has three uncorrelated patterns, while Mode II has electric and magnetic omnidirectional patterns. The resonant frequency of the antenna is 868 MHz with measured overlapped −6 dB impedance-bandwidths of 22 MHz and 20 MHz for Mode I and Mode II, respectively. The antenna is integrated in an \$80\times 55\$ mm2 terminal. The radiating elements consist of two meandered slots and one meandered monopole. Four pattern configurations are obtained with an average peak gain of 0 dBi, and an average radiation efficiency of 43.3%. Two of the patterns are with 5 dB directivity, and the other two are omnidirectional patterns. Pattern reconfigurability is achieved using four PIN diodes. The antenna is fabricated on a low-cost FR-4 substrate. By removing FR-4 material inside the slots, slots’ radiation efficiencies were improved by 2.25 dB.},
