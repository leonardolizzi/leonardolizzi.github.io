 abstract = {In this paper, a reconfigurable antenna integrated into a miniature device for asset tracking is presented. This antenna system has the ability to compensate environment effect by tuning the antenna resonance frequency. The proposed solution is assessed in two different scenarios: in free space and when the device is placed over a metallic surface.},
