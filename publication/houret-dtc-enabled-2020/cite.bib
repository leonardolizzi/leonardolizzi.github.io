 abstract = {In this letter, an integrated frequency-tunable inverted-F antenna is presented. Thanks to a reconfigurable circuit using a digitally tunable capacitor (DTC), the antenna resonant frequency can be shifted over 32 different positions from 600 to 960 MHz. This tunability is used to compensate the frequency detuning caused by the change in the antenna close surrounding. The small dimensions as well as the digital control and the low power consumption of the reconfiguration circuit make the proposed antenna a good candidate for Internet of Things applications.},
