 abstract = {This paper presents a very low consuming re-configurable antenna suitable for ultra-low power internet-of-things (IoT) devices. Thanks to the use of a Digital Tunable Capacitor (DTC), the antenna can be reconfigured to obtain good impedance matching and optimized efficiency for different configurations of the close environment.},
