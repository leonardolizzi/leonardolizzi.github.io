 abstract = {A miniature antenna working in European, Asian and Australian ISM sub-GHz bands is presented for IoT application. The antenna was first designed and simulated to achieve a low quality factor, i.e. having good matching at 896MHz. A second-order matching network was then designed to make the antenna achieve broadband between dual desired band at 868 MHz and 922 MHz, which do not satisfy the bands requirements. Finally, the components' values are updated to obtain dual-band behaviour.},
