 abstract = {This paper proposes a miniature reconfigurable Inverted-F antenna (IFA) covering three different frequency bands. The target application is the Internet of Things (IoT) which requires the use of a miniature antenna to obtain location information using the GPS standard and send it to the server using the Low Power Wide Area Network (LP-WAN) standard.},
