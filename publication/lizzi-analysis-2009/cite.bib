 abstract = {In this paper, the effects of geometrical perturbations on the geometry of a reference fractal antenna have been carefully analyzed to provide a set of analytic rules for describing the resonant behavior of the antenna. As regards to the antenna synthesis, the obtained results can be profitably used to initialize an optimization process for identifying an optimal solution thus allowing non-negligible saving of the computational resources.},
