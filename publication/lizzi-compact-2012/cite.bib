 abstract = {This paper presents a compact low-profile surface wave antenna for UMTS applications. It shows good impedance match and dipole-like omnidirectional radiation pattern over the band of interest. Numerical and experimental results are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.},
