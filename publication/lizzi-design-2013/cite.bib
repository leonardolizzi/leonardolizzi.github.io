 abstract = {In this paper, an approach for the design of antennas suitable for vehicular applications is presented. The resulting solutions are light, low-profile and they exhibit good impedance match and omnidirectional radiation pattern over the band of interest. Two representative test cases are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},
