 abstract = {This paper deals with the design of antennas enabling miniature and energy efficient wireless internet-of-things (IoT) devices for smart cities. Because of the characteristics required by IoT systems, some specific aspects must be considered during the antenna design phase. As a representative example, the design of a miniature position tracker is presented. The performance of the antenna as integrated into the device as well as of the final system in a real field test are presented.},
