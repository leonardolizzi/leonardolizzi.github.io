 abstract = {This paper discusses the design of miniature antennas for internet-of-things (IoT) applications. Differently from other communication systems, IoT devices have almost no bandwidth requirements, allowing for strong antenna miniaturization. However, several related aspects must be carefully considered during the antenna design phase. As a representative example, numerical and experimental results concerning the design of a miniature dual-band antenna for IoT geolocation application are presented.},
