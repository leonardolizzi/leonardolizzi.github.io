 abstract = {In this letter, a dual-band printed circuit board (PCB) antenna suitable for Wi-Fi applications is described. The antenna geometry is modeled by means of a spline curve and a partial metallic ground plane. The proposed antenna is suitable for Wi-Fi bands, and it guarantees good impedance-matching conditions at the working frequencies centered at 2.448 and 5.512 GHz, respectively. A prototype of the synthesized antenna, built on an Arlon substrate, is analyzed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed antenna model in terms of VSWR values as well as radiation patterns.},
