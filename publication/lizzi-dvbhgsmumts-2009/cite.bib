 abstract = {In this letter, the prototype of a planar antenna working in three different frequency bands and suitable to be integrated in multimode wireless devices is described. The antenna is fed by a single RF port without any matching circuit, and it operates in a DVBH channel and at GSM and UMTS frequency bands. Its dimension is of 0.15 lambda at the lower frequency band. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed antenna is assessed by means of both simulations and measurements.},
