 abstract = {This paper analyzes a method for the DOA estimation of correlated signals based on the integration of a SVM classifier and an iterative multi-scaling approach (IMSA). The aim of the SVM classifier is the definition of a probability map of the angular directions of incidence of the incoming signals starting from the knowledge of the correlation matrix of the antenna array, while the IMSA procedure is used to reduce the computational load as well as to increase the angular resolution accuracy.},
