 abstract = {This paper addresses the design and measurement of an implantable RFID tag for small animal monitoring applications. In particular, the design of a miniature printed dipole antenna and its integration with a commercial RFID transceiver is discussed. Some preliminary numerical results of the antenna performance when implanted under the mouse skin are presented. The experimental validation of the designed antenna in a realistic scenario will be successively provided.},
