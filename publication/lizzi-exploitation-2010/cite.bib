 abstract = {This paper presents an integrated inverse scattering approach to electromagnetic non-destructive evaluation. The method exploits the features of the multi-scaling scheme and the Inexact-Newton techniques for suitably addressing the ill-posedness and nonlinearity of the problem at hand. Preliminary numerical validations are reported to give an indication of the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},
