 abstract = {This paper discusses the exploitation of spline-based geometries in the synthesis of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) antennas. The synthesis is carried out in the time-domain by using the antenna efficiency and the system fidelity as indexes of the antenna performances. Numerical results demonstrate that the spline-based approach is more effective than other shape-free design techniques, such as the pixel-based approach.},
