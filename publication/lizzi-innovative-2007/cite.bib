 abstract = {In this paper, an innovative spline-based approach for the UWB antennas synthesis has been proposed. The flexibility and accuracy of the method allows a reliable matching of UWB requirements. A representative design example described through the arising simulated as well as experimental electrical parameters has been presented in order to confirm the effectiveness of the approach.},
