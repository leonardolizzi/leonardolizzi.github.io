 abstract = {In this letter, an antenna operating over the GSM band is proposed. Thanks to the use of a foam material as dielectric substrate, the prototype of this antenna is particularly light. It has a very low profile with overall dimensions equal to 0.31λ × 0.31λ × 0.09λ at the GSM center frequency, and it exhibits an omnidirectional radiation pattern similar to that of a classical half-wave dipole.},
