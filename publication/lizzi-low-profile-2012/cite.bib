 abstract = {A wire-patch antenna operating over the terrestrial trunked radio emergency and public safety standard is presented. It exploits the use of shorting wires to operate below its fundamental cavity resonance mode. Thanks to low-cost, low-profile, solidity, ease of fabrication, and dipole-like radiation pattern properties, it results to be particularly suitable for automotive applications. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
