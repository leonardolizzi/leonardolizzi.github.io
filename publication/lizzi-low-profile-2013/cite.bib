 abstract = {This paper presents a multimode antenna operating over the GSM, GPS and WIFI bands. The antenna exhibits an omnidirectional radiation diagram in the GSM band and a directive pattern at the GPS frequency. In addition, the proposed antenna has a low-profile, a solid structure and a reduced weight, which make it a good candidate for vehicular applications.},
