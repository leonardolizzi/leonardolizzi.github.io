 abstract = {This paper describes the design of a miniaturized multiband Inverted-F Antenna (IFA) suitable for integration in compact Internet-of-things (IoT) terminals. The antenna efficiently operates over the LoRa (915 MHz) and GPS L1 (1.57 GHz) and L2 (1.23 GHz) bands. Its dimensions are m ( compared to the lower operating frequency) for a total device size of m. Measurements of the antenna when integrated into an IoT position tracking device as well as of the whole terminal in a real application scenario are reported.},
