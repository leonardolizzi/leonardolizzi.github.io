 abstract = {This paper is aimed at proposing a multiband fractal antenna suitable for wireless communication systems devoted to emergency management. The synthesis of the antenna is carried out by means of an iterative procedure based on a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to identify the optimal descriptors of a perturbed Sierpinski geometry. The result is a miniaturized antenna exhibiting a good impedance matching within the Wi-Fi/WiMAX and Public Safety bands. The results from numerical validations and experimental tests are reported to demonstrate the effectiveness of the synthesized antenna as well as the reliability of the synthesis process.},
