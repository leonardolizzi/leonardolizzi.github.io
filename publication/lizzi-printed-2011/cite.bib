 abstract = {In this letter, a spline-shaped ultrawideband (UWB) antenna enabling simultaneous operability over multiple mobile wireless standards-namely the DCS, PCS, UMTS, and ISM bands-is proposed. The antenna is expected to exhibit a good impedance matching and stable radiation features within the whole range of working frequencies. A set of numerical and experimental results is reported to assess the efficiency of the proposed design.},
