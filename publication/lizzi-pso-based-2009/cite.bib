 abstract = {In this paper, an approach for the synthesis of antenna systems suitable for UWB communication applications has been presented. The final antenna geometry is obtained by means of a PSO aimed at fitting a set of time domain requirements. Such requirements allow the radiating system to have an high efficiency, distortionless properties, and omnidirectional radiation patterns over the whole frequency range. An example of synthesized antenna has been shown as a preliminary assessment of the proposed approach.},
