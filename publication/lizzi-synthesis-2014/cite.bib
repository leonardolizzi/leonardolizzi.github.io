 abstract = {This paper presents an approach for the synthesis of pattern-reconfigurable antenna suitable for integration into smart wireless sensor nodes. As a proof-of-concept, a simple antenna configuration capable of steering the radiation main beam towards two opposite directions is discussed. The antenna exhibits a good impedance match in the WiFi band, compact dimensions (0.47λ × 0.2λ × 0.1λ), and high gain (7.56 dBi) and front-to-back ratio (11.26 dB).},
