 abstract = {A design approach based on transmission line theory for the synthesis of pattern reconfigurable antennas is presented. It allows the design of a single input port parasitic elements antenna fulfilling user-defined requirements on a target radiation pattern. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated in dealing with a low profile directive antenna capable of switching its radiation pattern towards two opposite directions.},
