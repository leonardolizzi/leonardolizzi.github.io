 abstract = {The advantages of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology in ultrawideband (UWB) communication systems are investigated evaluating the channel capacity from measurements taken in indoor environments. The results suggest that in practical instances spatial diversity is more attractive than spatial multiplexing for ultrawideband systems.},
