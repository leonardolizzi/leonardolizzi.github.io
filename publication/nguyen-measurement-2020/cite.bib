 abstract = {This paper presents simulation and measurement calculations of total scanning power and coverage efficiency parameters. The simulated and measured coverage efficiency Cumulative Distributive Function (CDF) are similar for high gain. Important discrepancy are observed for low gain because of uncertainties in simulation model and measurement processes.},
