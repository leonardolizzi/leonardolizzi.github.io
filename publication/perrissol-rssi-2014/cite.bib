 abstract = {The need in biological telemetry relevance has been growing steadily for many years. A localization system, working in the SRD (Short Range Devices) frequency band of 863870MHz dedicated to the laboratory mice, is presented in this paper. It is constituted of a battery-less RFID tag implanted in a mouse phantom model, interrogated by an array of four cross printed dipoles used as emitting antennas connected to an external reader. The device is applied to a standard plexiglas rack cage for housing mice. The mouse phantom model localization in the cage is deduced from the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) level measurements of each antenna. Four zones are defined, one for each antenna and the position is determined by the highest received RSSI level. Two cases have been considered depending if there is one or four phantom models present simultaneously in the cage. Results show a good correlation between the real positions and the RSSI levels obtained by the four antennas.},
