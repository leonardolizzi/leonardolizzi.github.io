 abstract = {This paper presents a multiband MIMO antenna system with four accesses, with very good performance despite the complex environment that surrounds it. This environment consists of a thick plastic radome protecting the antenna and an aluminum metallic radiator placed behind it, which is usually not recommended to not disturb the operation of any antenna. The antenna has been studied in its environment and it presents in simulation very good levels of impedance matching, isolation and efficiency. This last one almost exceeds 80 % on three LTE bands: [0.7-0.9], [1.71-1.88] and [2.5-2.69] GHz. This system was then realized and measured in free space. The comparison of simulated and measured results validates the good functioning of the MIMO system.},
