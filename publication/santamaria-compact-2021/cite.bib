 abstract = {In this paper, a compact antenna suitable for integration in Internet-of-Things (IoT) terminals and whose performance approach the lower Q-factor theoretical bound is presented. The proposed antenna structure is a parasitic element array based on two Inverted-F Antenna (IFA) radiators sharing the same ground plane. The antenna exhibits a directive pattern that can be electronically steered integrating a simple reconÔ¨Ågurable feeding network.},
