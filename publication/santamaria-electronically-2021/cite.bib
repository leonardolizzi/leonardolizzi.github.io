 abstract = {In this paper, an electronically pattern reconfigurable antenna for Internet of Things (IoT) applications is presented. The antenna consists of 4 wire-patches sharing the same ground plane. This radiating element can switch between four end-fire radiation states in less than 5 us and achieves a 290 MHz frequency bandwidth from 2.25 to 2.54 GHz. The results show that this antenna can realize a peak gain of 3.9 dBi at 2.44 GHz and a front-to-back ratio greater than 6.5 dB. A single low-power, low-insertion loss SP4T switch enables the radiation pattern steering. This approach avoids the use of multiple electronic components in the reconfiguration mechanism, thus accommodating the IoT microcontrollerâ€™s limited resource constraints. The antenna structure is compact and printed on two cost-effective FR-4 printed circuit boards (PCBs). Thanks to its high performance, small size, low cost, and low-power characteristics, the proposed structure is suitable for IoT applications.},
