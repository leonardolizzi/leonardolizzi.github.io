 abstract = {In this paper, an optimization driven method for the synthesis of pattern reconfigurable parasitic antenna arrays is presented. The proposed approach allows the design of antennas fulfilling different performance requirements. Two test cases, aimed at optimizing the antenna directivity and front-to-back ratio, respectively, are presented.},
