 abstract = {A 4 Ã— 4 MIMO multiband antenna system for mobile handsets is proposed in this paper. The placement of the elements on the terminal chassis as well as the single structure has been optimized in order to reduce the Envelope Correlation Coefficient (ECC). Simulated and measured results, including also the integration with a a real 7-inch commercial tablet, aimed at validating the proposed solution are presented.},
