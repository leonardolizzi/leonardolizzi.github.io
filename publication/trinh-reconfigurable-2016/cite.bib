 abstract = {This letter presents a reconfigurable antenna for mobile terminals with extended band coverage obtained by using a digitally tunable capacitor (DTC). The antenna structure is matched permanently over high frequency bands including DCS/PCS, UMTS, LTE 1800/2600, and 3.5-GHz bands. Concerning the sub-GHz bands, several reconfigurable states enable a full coverage of LTE 600/700 and GSM 850/900 standards, as well as expected spectrum reallocations for 5G communications. With dimensions of 40 ×10 ×6 mm3 for the antenna and 130 ×70 ×0.8 mm3 for the whole printed circuit board (PCB), this structure is compatible with any mobile terminal.},
