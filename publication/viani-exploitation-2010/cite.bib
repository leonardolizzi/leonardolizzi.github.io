 abstract = {The integration of smart antennas in wireless sensor networks is a challenging and very attractive technical solution to improve the system capacity, the quality of service, and the power control. In this paper, some benefits coming from such an integration are experimentally assessed dealing with a set of test scenarios. Finally, some conclusions are discussed in order to point out current potentialities and limitations of the smart antennas integration to envisage future and possible advances.},
