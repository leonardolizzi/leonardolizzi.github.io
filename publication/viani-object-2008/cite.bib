 abstract = {The localisation of moving and transceiver-free objects is addressed by processing the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) available at the nodes of a wireless sensor network. Starting from the RSSI measurements, the probability of the presence of unknown mobile objects is determined by means of a customised classification approach based on a support vector machine. Experimental results assess the feasibility of the proposed approach.},
