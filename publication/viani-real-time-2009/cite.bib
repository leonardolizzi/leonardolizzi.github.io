 abstract = {In this paper, an innovative approach for the localization and tracking of a passive target in an indoor non-infrastructured environment has been presented. The proposed strategy is based on a LBE approach in order to define at each time step a map of risk of the presence of the target. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed strategy does require neither the use of specific sensors nor the equipment of radio devices for the object to be tracked, since only the interactions between the target and the wireless links are exploited. The numerical validation performed in a realistic noisy environment has pointed out the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed tracking methodology.},
