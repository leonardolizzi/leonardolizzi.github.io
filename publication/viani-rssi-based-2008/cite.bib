 abstract = {The problem of object localization in Wireless
Sensor Networks is dealt with a Support Vector Machine classifier
exploiting the Received Signal Strength Indicator measured by
WSN nodes. The SVM is trained once and offline, so the real-time
functionality during the test phase is guaranteed. Unlike other
methods devoted to nodes localization, the proposed approach
solves the problem of localization and tracking of an unknown
object (e.g. human beings) that does not belong to the WSN
infrastructure. A preliminary result from the assessment of
the feasibility of the SVM-based localization/tracking method is
presented and discussed.},
