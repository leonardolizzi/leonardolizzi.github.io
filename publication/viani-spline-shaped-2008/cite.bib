 abstract = {A spline-shaped antenna for ultra-wideband communications that operates in the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) released band from 6 up to 8.5 GHz is described. Selected simulated and measured data are reported to assess the achieved impedance matching over the whole band of interest and the distortionless behaviour, as well as to show the omnidirectional radiation properties.},
