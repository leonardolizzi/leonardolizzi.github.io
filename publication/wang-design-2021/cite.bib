 abstract = {An Internet of Things (IoT) terminal supporting four frequency bands is presented. The dimension of the terminal is 300×30×0.8 mm3. It integrates a LoRa 868 MHz antenna, a dual-band GNSS antenna (used for Galileo navigation), and a LoRa 2.4 GHz Inverted-F Antenna (IFA) realized on an FR-4 substrate. This kind of terminal can be manufactured directly through a printed circuit board (PCB) technology, which makes it low-cost and suitable for IoT applications.},
